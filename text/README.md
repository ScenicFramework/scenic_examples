# Scenic Examples: Text

This app demonstrates the basic usage of text primitives.

Things to note:

* For custom fonts, add them to your `assets/fonts` folder and register their aliases in the config.
* `line_height` is a multiple of the line height. 0 means no spacing between lines, 1 is normal, etc.
* `text_align` only takes on `:left`, `:center`, or `:right` now--previous versions had more options.
