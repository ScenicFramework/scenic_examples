# Scenic Examples: Translate Transforms

This project is meant to show how translations work in Scenic.

Things to note:

* Translations go on the X-axis from left-to-right (0 to viewport size).
* Translations go on the Y-axis from top-to-bottom (0 to viewport height).
* Translations on a group will be applied to anything inside that group, even if they have their own translations.
