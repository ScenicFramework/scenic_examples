# Scenic Examples: Sprites

This project shows how to use sprites. It uses an example sprite sheet from OpenGameArt.org, available [here](https://opengameart.org/content/weird-fruits-16x16).

Things to note:

* It's totally fine to describe a destination rectangle smaller or larger than the source region on the sprite.
* Unlike most other primitive commands, currently no transforms or styles are applied to sprites.
* If you want to transform sprites, you'll need to use groups.
